# SCALP
created by Hung, Hunter, and Minh

SCALP (Symbolic CALculus Program) is a program written in C++ that performs symbolic integration. It uses abstract syntax trees to represent indefinite integrals. The program is a work in progress, but in its current state it can evaluate some indefinite integrals using safe transformations. For example, SCALP can evaluate the integral "5x^3 - 10x^6 + 4" with respect to x and return a symbolic result.
